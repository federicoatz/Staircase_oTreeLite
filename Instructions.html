    Welcome to the second part of the experiment
</p>
 <p>
{% blocktrans trimmed %}
Please imagine the following situation. You can choose between a sure payment of a particular amount of money, or a draw, where you would have an equal chance of getting amount x or getting nothing. We will present to you five different situations. What would you prefer: a draw with a 50% chance of receiving amount x, and the same 50% chance of receiving nothing, or the amount of y as a sure payment?    </p>
    <p>
After completing all 5 choices, one of the choices will be randomly picked to determine your payoff. If you choose the lottery, a random draw will determine whether the high or low outcome will constitute your payoff. Otherwise, the sure payment will include your payoff.
